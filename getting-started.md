# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts you need to know to begin your journey as a web developer.

## The Basics

Every web developer should start with these three core technologies:

1. **HTML** - The structure
2. **CSS** - The style
3. **JavaScript** - The functionality

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website. It provides the basic structure and content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) makes your websites look beautiful by adding style and layout.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### JavaScript

JavaScript brings interactivity to your websites by adding behavior and functionality.

```javascript
document.querySelector('h1').addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Hello, developer!');
});
```

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore:

- Frontend frameworks like React or Vue
- Backend development with Node.js
- Database management
- Version control with Git

Remember, the key to becoming a successful web developer is practice and persistence. Start small, build projects, and keep learning!
